# Neural Signal Analysis 
This project analyzes EEG data to uncover neural activity patterns, focusing on time series trends, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spike train analysis, and neural tuning curves. It applies advanced techniques to interpret brain signals and predict stimulus conditions based on neural firing rates.
